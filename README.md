# Project Description: Hotel Review Sentiment Analysis Using NLP

# Problem Statement

  In the competitive hospitality industry, understanding customer feedback is crucial for maintaining and improving service quality. The challenge is to automatically classify hotel reviews into different 
  sentiment categories, such as "angry," "good," or "neutral," to quickly identify areas needing attention and to leverage positive feedback for marketing purposes. Manual analysis of reviews is time-consuming 
  and prone to human error, making an automated solution highly desirable.

# Project Objective
  To develop an NLP-based sentiment analysis model that classifies hotel reviews into specific sentiment categories, providing actionable insights to hotel management for enhancing customer satisfaction and 
  service quality.

# Methodology
  Data Collection
    - Gathered a dataset of hotel reviews from various online sources. Each review contained text and associated metadata, such as the rating provided by the customer.
    
  Data Preprocessing
    - Text Cleaning: Removed HTML tags, punctuation, numbers, and special characters to clean the text data.
    - Lowercasing: Converted all text to lowercase to maintain uniformity.
    - Tokenization: Split the text into individual words or tokens.
    - Stop Words Removal: Removed common stop words (e.g., 'and', 'the', 'is') that do not contribute to the sentiment.
    - Lemmatization/Stemming: Reduced words to their base or root form to standardize the text data.
    
  Feature Extraction
    - Bag of Words (BoW): Represented text data as a bag of words, capturing the frequency of each word in the text.
    - TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency): Weighted the importance of words based on their frequency and how unique they are across all documents.
    - Word Embeddings: Used pre-trained word embeddings like Word2Vec or GloVe to capture semantic meaning.
    
   Model Building
    - Model Selection: Evaluated various machine learning algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines (SVM), Random Forest, and Deep Learning models like LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) for     
      their performance on the classification task.
    - Training: Split the dataset into training and test sets. Trained the selected models on the training set and validated them on the test set.
    - Hyperparameter Tuning: Optimized model parameters using techniques like Grid Search or Random Search to improve performance.
    
  Model Evaluation
    - Accuracy: Measured the percentage of correctly classified reviews.
    - Precision, Recall, and F1-Score: Evaluated these metrics to understand the model's performance, especially for the "angry" review class, which is critical for identifying customer dissatisfaction.
    - Confusion Matrix: Analyzed the confusion matrix to see the distribution of predicted versus actual classes.
      Results
  
  The best-performing model achieved an accuracy of X%, with the following metrics for the "angry" class:
  
  Precision: 0.88%
  Recall: 0.88%
  Accuracy: 0.88%
  
  These results indicate that the model is effective in identifying different sentiments in hotel reviews, particularly in pinpointing negative feedback.
  
  Business Impact
  The sentiment analysis model provides the following benefits to hotel management:
  
    - Quick Identification of Issues: Automatically flags negative reviews, allowing for rapid response and resolution of customer complaints.
    - Enhanced Customer Satisfaction: By addressing issues promptly, hotels can improve their service quality, leading to higher customer satisfaction and loyalty.
    - Data-Driven Decisions: Insights from sentiment analysis can inform strategic decisions, such as training programs for staff, improvements in facilities, or marketing strategies.
    - Positive Review Leverage: Positive reviews can be identified and highlighted in marketing campaigns to attract more customers.
  
  #Future Work
    Model Improvement: Incorporate more advanced NLP techniques and larger datasets to improve model accuracy.
    Multilingual Support: Extend the model to analyze reviews in multiple languages to cater to a global customer base.
    Integration: Integrate the sentiment analysis model with existing customer relationship management (CRM) systems for seamless operation.
    
  By automating the sentiment analysis of hotel reviews, this project empowers hotel management to proactively enhance the guest experience and maintain a competitive edge in the industry.
